## Project title
This project was called Better Doctors. It is an easy and efficient way to connect patients with the most suitable health care professionals across the United States

## Motivation
We wanted to fill a gap in user experience when searching for a doctor and finding the best matches. A simple google search looking for dermatologists in San Diego that speak spanish yielded inconsistent results, where sometimes there were clinics and doctors on the list, and no easy way to navigate throughout the searches.

## Tech/framework used
It was built using html, materialize.css and javascript

## Features
1) It is mobile responsive
2) The ability to save the results in a favorites folder
3) The page can be translated into Spanish
4) Users can search for doctors that speak spanish, english or french, search for male or female doctors, as well as many subspecialties in medicine.
